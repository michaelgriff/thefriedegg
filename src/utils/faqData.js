    question: "I don't have a partner, is that an issue?",
    answer:
      "Not at all! Roughly 30-40% of our fields are singles who come and get paired with other golf nuts. We try out best to pair similar handicap ranges so everyone feels comfortable with the player they're partnered up with.",
